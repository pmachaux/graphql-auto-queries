# Deployment steps:

# What to do

- Better recursive dataloaders:
  - Test multiple queries
  - Test same querie but double with different requested fields.
  - Test with spread fragments.
- General:

  - Test that multiple queries work properly.
  - Test with fragments (spread).
  - Ensure everything is working with inline variables

- Add support for inline fragments.
- Refactor dataloader.utils to not use visit but only the function we to handle what is in entities handler.
  This will be easier to maintain and understand.
